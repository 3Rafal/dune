Project layout
**************

A typical dune project will have a ``dune-project`` and one or more
``<package>.opam`` file at the root as well as ``dune`` files wherever
interesting things are: libraries, executables, tests, documents to install,
etc...

It is recommended to organize your project so that you have exactly one library
per directory. You can have several executables in the same directory, as long
as they share the same build configuration. If you'd like to have multiple
executables with different configurations in the same directory, you will have
to make an explicit module list for every executable using ``modules``.

The next sections describe the format of dune metadata files.

Note that the dune metadata format is versioned in order to ensure forward
compatibility. There is currently only one version available, but to be future
proof, you should still specify it in your ``dune`` files. If no version is
specified, the latest one will be used.

.. _scopes:

Scopes
------

Any directory containing at least one ``<package>.opam`` file defines
a scope. This scope is the sub-tree starting from this directory,
excluding any other scopes rooted in sub-direcotries.

Typically, any given project will define a single scope. Libraries and
executables that are not meant to be installed will be visible inside
this scope only.

Because scopes are exclusive, if you wish to include the dependencies
of the project you are currently working on into your workspace, you
may copy them in a ``vendor`` directory, or any other name of your
choice. Dune will look for them there rather than in the installed
world and there will be no overlap between the various scopes.

Package version
---------------

Note that dune will try to determine the version number of packages
defined in the workspace. While dune itself makes no use of version
numbers, it can be use by external tools such as
`ocamlfind <http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html>`__.

Dune determines the version of a package by trying the following
methods in order:

- it looks in the ``<package>.opam`` file for a ``version`` variable
- it looks for a ``<package>.version`` file in the same directory and
  reads the first line
- it looks for the version specified in the ``dune-project`` if present
- it looks for a ``version`` file and reads the first line
- it looks for a ``VERSION`` file and reads the first line

``<package>.version``, ``version`` and ``VERSION`` files may be
generated.

If the version can't be determined, dune just won't assign one.

Odig conventions
----------------

Dune follows the `odig <http://erratique.ch/software/odig>`__
conventions and automatically installs any README\*, CHANGE\*, HISTORY\*
and LICENSE\* files in the same directory as the ``<package>.opam`` file
to a location where odig will find them.

Note that this includes files present in the source tree as well as
generated files. So for instance a changelog generated by a user rule
will be automatically installed as well.
